# Glass Overflow Simulator

This repository contains an object-oriented solution in Java or C# to calculate the time it takes for a given glass in a pyramid of glasses to start overflowing. The program prompts the user for a row and glass position, then determines the time in seconds before the selected glass overflows. The solution emphasizes readability and maintainability over optimization. The code takes into account the rate of water flow, doubling in the middle glass of each row, and handles precision constraints. An illustrative example and execution sample are provided.
